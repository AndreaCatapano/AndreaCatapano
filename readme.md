# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea Catapano  

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** from Naples 🇮🇹 with experience in building web, mobile, and game applications.  
I enjoy working across the stack, from designing **monolithic and service-oriented architectures** to creating **engaging user interfaces** and **scalable backends**.  
Beyond coding, I’m a nerd at heart who loves video games and Magic: The Gathering 🎮✨
